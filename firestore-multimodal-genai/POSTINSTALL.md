## See It In Action

You can test out this extension right away!

1. Go to your Cloud Firestore dashboard in the Firebase console.
2. If it doesn't exist, create the collection that you specified during installation: ${param:COLLECTION_NAME}.
3. Add a document to this collection. You may have specified some variables (${param:VARIABLE_FIELDS}) as part of your prompt that are meant to be substituted. Add those fields to the Firestore document, and the extension will substitute the values into the prompt before calling Google AI.
4. In a few seconds, you'll see a status field appear in the document. This field will update as the extension processes the message.
   When processing is finished, the ${param:RESPONSE_FIELD} field of the document should be populated with the response generated by Google AI.

Note: You can also use the Firebase Admin SDK to add a document:

```javascript
const ref = await admin
    .firestore()
    .collection("${param:COLLECTION_NAME}")
    .add({ ... }) // Include values for ${param:VARIABLE_FIELDS} fields

ref.onSnapshot(snap => {
    if (snap.get('${param:RESPONSE_FIELD}')) console.log(
        'RESPONSE:',
        snap.get('${param:RESPONSE_FIELD}')
    )
})
```

## About the providers

The extension gives you a choice of what provider to use for the available models:

- Google AI: For more details on this Gemini API, see the [Gemini homepage](https://ai.google.dev/docs).

## About the models

The extension gives you a choice of 3 models:

- [Gemini Pro](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini) text model
- [Gemini Pro Vision](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini)

## Handling errors

If the extension encounters an error, it will write an error message to the document in `status` field. You can use this field to monitor for errors in your documents. Currently some errors will instruct you to visit the Cloud Function logs for the extension, to avoid exposing sensitive information.

## Monitoring

As a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.
