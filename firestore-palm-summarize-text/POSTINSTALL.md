## See it in action

You can test out the extension right away by following these steps:

1. Go to the [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore) in the Firebase console.
2. If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: **${param:COLLECTION_NAME}**.
3. Add a document to this collection with a **${param:TEXT_FIELD}** field containing a string of text you wish to summarize.
4. In a few seconds, you'll see a status field appear in the document. The status field will update as the extension processes the message.
5. When processing is finished, the ${param:RESPONSE_FIELD} field of the document should be populated with the response generated by the PaLM API.

Note: You can also use the Firebase Admin SDK to add a document:
```javascript
const ref = await admin
    .firestore()
    .collection("${param:COLLECTION_NAME}")
    .add({
        ${param:TEXT_FIELD}: "some text you want summarized"
    })

ref.onSnapshot(snap => {
    if (snap.get('${param:RESPONSE_FIELD}')) console.log(
        'RESPONSE:',
        snap.get('${param:RESPONSE_FIELD}')
    )
})
```

## Monitoring

As a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.
