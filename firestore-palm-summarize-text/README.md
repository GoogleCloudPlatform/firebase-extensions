# Summarize Text with PaLM API

**Author**: Google Cloud (**[https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com/)**)

**Description**: Summarizes text in Firestore documents using PaLM API.



**Details**: This extension allows you to summarize a field in a Firestore document using the Vertex AI PaLM API.

On installation, you will need to specify the following information:

- **Firestore collection path:** The path to the Firestore collection that contains the documents to summarize.
- **Document field to summarize:** The name of the document field to summarize.
- **Target summary length (number of sentences):** The desired length of the summary in sentences.
- **Response field:** The name of the field in the document to store the summary.

This extension will listen to the specified collection for new document writes and execute the following logic:

1. Call the PaLM API to generate a summary of the document field.
2. Write the summary back to the triggering document in the response field.

### Use cases

This extension can be used for a variety of use cases, including:

- Summarizing customer feedback
- Abstracting long articles
- Condensing user-generated content

Here are some examples of how this extension can be used:

- An e-commerce platform could use this extension to automatically generate summaries of customer feedback, giving customers a quick overview of the feedback before they decide whether to read the full content.
- A news website could use this extension to summarize articles, helping readers decide whether they want to invest their time in reading the full article.
- A social media platform could use this extension to provide summaries of user-generated content, improving content discoverability and user engagement.

### Regenerating a response

Changing the state field of a completed document's status from `COMPLETED` to anything else will retrigger the extension for that document.
