# Convert Text to Speech

**Author**: Google Cloud (**[https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com/)**)

**Description**: Converts Firestore documents to audio files stored in Cloud Storage using Cloud Text to Speech.



**Details**: This extension converts text from Firestore documents into speech using the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.

Upon install you will be asked to provide a Firestore collection path and a Storage path. Any document writes to this collection will trigger a Cloud Function that does the following:

* Generates an audio version of the same text
* Stores it in Cloud Storage in the specified path
* Writes the path to the Storage object back in the same document.

## Use Cases
* **Accessibility**: A key strength of TTS lies in fostering inclusive access to digital content for people with visual impairments or who face reading challenges. By utilizing TTS, we can work towards providing equal opportunities for everyone to obtain information, acknowledging and embracing the diverse abilities and requirements of all users.
* **Language learning**: TTS can be a handy tool for language learners, as it can help users to practice their pronunciation and improve their listening comprehension. By providing accurate and natural-sounding speech, TTS can help language learners to develop their language skills in a more immersive and interactive way.
* **Navigation**: In-car navigation systems often use TTS to give drivers turn-by-turn directions. TTS can help drivers keep their eyes on the road and avoid distractions by providing spoken instructions, improving safety.
* **Virtual assistants**: Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant rely heavily on TTS to provide users with helpful information and complete tasks. Using TTS, virtual assistants can create a more natural and conversational experience for users, enhancing their overall usability.

## Additional Setup

Before installing this extension, make sure that you've set up a [Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) and [Cloud Storage bucket](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) in your Firebase project.

Keep in mind that not all SSML genders and voice types are supported for every language. The Text to Speech API documentation gives a comprehensive list of [supported voices and languages](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices).

## Billing

To install an extension, your project must be on the Blaze (pay as you go) plan.

You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).

This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:

* [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech#section-11)
* Cloud Firestore
* Cloud Storage
* Cloud Functions (Node.js 14+ runtime. See [FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))




**Configuration Parameters:**

* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).

* Collection path: What collection path contains documents with text you want to convert?


* Bucket name: In which storage bucket do you want to keep converted text?


* Storage path: What is the location in your storage bucket you would like to keep converted audio? By default this will be the root of the bucket.


* Enable ssml: If set to \"Yes\", text processed by this extension will be assumed to be written in ssml.

* Language code: What language code do you want to use?

* Voice type: What voice type do you want to use?

* SSML Gender: What SSML Gender do you want to use?

* Audio Encoding: What audio encoding do you want to use?

* Enable per document overrides.: If set to \"Yes\", options for converting audio will be overwritten  by fields in the document containing the text to be converted.

* Voice name: Alternatively you may specify a voice name, this will override other extension conversion parameters (language code, SSML Gender, Voice type).




**Cloud Functions:**

* **textToSpeech:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, writing synthesized natural speech files to Cloud Storage



**APIs Used**:

* texttospeech.googleapis.com (Reason: To use Google Text to Speech to generate natural sounding speech from your strings in Firestore.)



**Access Required**:



This extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:

* datastore.user (Reason: Allows the extension to write translated strings to Cloud Firestore.)

* storage.objectAdmin (Reason: Allows the extension to write translated strings to Cloud Storage.)
