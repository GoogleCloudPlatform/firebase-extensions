    description: >
      Restrict storage-image-text-extraction to only extract text from images in
      specific locations in your Storage bucket by  supplying a comma-separated
      list of absolute paths. For example, specifying the paths
      `/users/pictures,/restaurants/menuItems` will process any images found in
      any subdirectories of `/users/pictures` and `/restaurants/menuItems`.

      If you prefer not to explicitly exclude any directories of your Storage
      bucket, leave this field empty.

    description: >
      Ensure storage-image-text-extraction does *not* process images in
      _specific locations_ in your Storage bucket by  supplying a
      comma-separated list of absolute paths. For example, to *exclude* the
      images  stored in the `/foo/alpha` and its subdirectories and `/bar/beta`
      and its subdirectories, specify the paths `/foo/alpha,/bar/beta`.

      If you prefer to process every image uploaded to your Storage bucket,
      leave this field empty.

    example: '/users/avatars/thumbs,/design/pictures/thumbs'
