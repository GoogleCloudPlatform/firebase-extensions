## Complete your installation

You will need to first add some security rules to a new Firestore collection used for storing backfill state.

Head to [Cloud Firestore Rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules) page, and add the following rules:

```js
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /_ext-${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}/{document=**} {
      // Deny read and write operations
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, make sure you enabled data **read & write access in Cloud Audit Log** for Vertex AI API. The instructions to enable are as follows:
- [Visit this page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/audit?cloudshell=false) and ensure that you have selected the project you’d like to install this extension in, using the project picker.
- Filter for “Vertex AI API” and click on the checkbox next to it. A new panel should appear on the right side of the page.
- On the new panel, click on the checkboxes next to “Data Read” and “Data Write”, and click Save.

## Try it out

Once processing is complete, a Callable function will be available to the user to use for queries. Queries are just a string that will be matched against all data in the Index.

Calling the function using the gcloud CLI:

```bash
gcloud functions --project ${param:PROJECT_ID} call ext-${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}-queryIndex --data '{"data": {"query":[""]}}'
```

Sample request body:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "query": ["I am a query"]
  }
}
```

Sample response:

```json
{
  "nearestNeighbors": [
    {
      "id": "0",
      "neighbors": [
        {
          "datapoint": {
            "datapointId": "zVnAFpQQd6LDntOPhWlk",
            "crowdingTag": {
              "crowdingAttribute": "0"
            }
          },
          "distance": 0.40997931361198425
        },
        {
          "datapoint": {
            "datapointId": "VjdCBMgq939nUB846TZ2",
            "crowdingTag": {
              "crowdingAttribute": "0"
            }
          },
          "distance": 0.36510562896728516
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

The response contains** only document IDs**, not the full data, since the extension shouldn’t be bypassing any security rules defined by the developer. The app can then get the documents using a client SDK.

## Example client integration

Now that you have an index with data in it, you can run text similarity search queries directly from your client application. Note that this Callable Function is protected by App Check and requires that you are signed in with a [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) call the Function from your client application.

```js
import firebase from "firebase";
import { getFunctions, httpsCallable } from "firebase/functions";

const functions = getFunctions();
const search = httpsCallable(functions, `ext-${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}-queryIndex`);

// run search
await search({ query: searchQuery })
  .then(async (result) => {
    // get results
    const { nearestNeighbours } = result.data;
    const paths  = nearestNeighbours.neighbours.map($ => $.datapoint.datapointId);

    // fetch documents from Firestore using the ids...
});
```
Depending on your security rules, you may need to add additional filters to the Firestore query for retrieving the actual document content to prevent Firestore from returning permission errors.

### Error Handling

If there are any errors during the query process, the extension will log the error message in the Cloud Functions logs. Make sure to monitor these logs and handle any errors appropriately in your application.

## Uninstalling the Extension

The extension does not delete or undeploy the Matching Engine Index automatically when you uninstall the extension. Vertex AI charges by node hour when hosting a Matching Engine Index, so your project will continue to incur costs until you manually undeploy the index. Instructions for undeploying an index are available [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/matching-engine/deploy-index-public#undeploy-index).

## Monitoring

As a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.
